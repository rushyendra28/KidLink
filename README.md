Parental Control Application

## Getting Started

Introduction

As digital engagement among children continues to grow, smartphones have become their primary gateway to the internet. Studies reveal that children spend several hours daily on digital devices, leading to concerns about excessive screen time and unregulated app usage. Prolonged exposure to screens can negatively impact mental health, reducing attention span, increasing anxiety, and disrupting sleep patterns. Additionally, unrestricted access to various applications can expose children to inappropriate content, cyber threats, and reduced productivity in academic and extracurricular activities.​

To address these challenges, an effective parental monitoring system plays a crucial role in helping parents track and manage their child's digital consumption. By offering real-time insights into screen time and app usage, parents can enforce healthy digital habits and ensure a balanced lifestyle. This system employs a technology-driven approach by utilizing JSON for efficient data storage and management while integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to provide instant notifications and alerts. With these features, the monitoring system enables proactive intervention, ensuring children's digital safety and fostering responsible device usage.​
